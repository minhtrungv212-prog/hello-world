# ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!

Hi there, my name is **Trung** â€“ a student and also a **self-taught developer**.  

## ðŸŒ± About Me
- Currently learning the fundamentals of programming by myself.  
- My goal is to become a developer who can contribute to open-source projects.  
- Passionate about exploring new technologies and experimenting with small projects.  

## ðŸš€ Why I Learn Programming
I believe technology has the power to change how we live and work.  
Even though starting late comes with challenges, I see this journey as an opportunity to grow, learn, and build meaningful projects.  

## ðŸ“Œ This Repository
This is my very first "Hello World" repo, created to mark the beginning of my coding journey on GitHub.  
Here Iâ€™ll keep my first lines of code and update my progress as I continue learning.
